/*
solution to Repeated DNA Sequences at leetcode in Java.

Problem Statement:
All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', for example: "ACGAATTCCG". When studying DNA,
it is sometimes useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.
Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.

Example 1:
Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"
Output: ["AAAAACCCCC","CCCCCAAAAA"]

Example 2:
Input: s = "AAAAAAAAAAAAA"
Output: ["AAAAAAAAAA"]
 
Idea:
my idea is to get all the possible 10 letter long sequences and put them into set,
if the operation failed, it means there are duplicates.
so put the sequence into another set("AAAAAAAAAAAA" could have three "AAAAAAAAAA" sequences,
 so this set will remove the duplicates) then add all the set to the final list.

            String sub = s.substring(i, i + 10);

                resset.add(sub);
