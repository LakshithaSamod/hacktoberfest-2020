"""
This is an optimized program to compute the gratest common divisor (GCD) of 2 given non-negative numbers.
The naive approach of finding GCD consumes enormous amount of time, such approaches fail in cases of very large numbers (in order of 10^5, 10^8, etc.).
Here, I have used Euclidean algorithm to calculate GCD. Go to https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/modarithmetic/a/the-euclidean-algorithm , to read more!
